def process_tubedata(df):
    """
    Process a DataFrame containing London Tube data to create useful data structures for an AI route finder.

    The function reads tube data with columns representing station names, nxt_station details, and zone information.
    It constructs two dictionaries: one mapping each station to its directly nxt_station stations with associated travel
    costs, and another mapping each station to its respective zones.

    Parameters:
    - df (pandas.DataFrame): A DataFrame with each row formatted as:
      [StartingStation], [EndingStation], [TubeLine], [AverageTimeTaken], [MainZone], [SecondaryZone]
      where `AverageTimeTaken` is the travel time in minutes, `MainZone` is the main zone of the starting station,
      and `SecondaryZone` is the secondary zone of the starting station (or 0 if it doesn't span multiple zones).

    Returns:
    - tuple:
        - station_dict (defaultdict of list): A dictionary where each key is a station name and each value is a list of 
          tuples (nxt_station station, travel cost, line name).
        - zone_dict (defaultdict of set): A dictionary where each key is a station name and each value is a set of zones 
          that station belongs to. If a station's secondary zone is not 0, it's added to both the start and end stations.

    Example usage:
    >>> df = pandas.read_csv("tubedata.csv")
    >>> station_dict, zone_dict = process_tubedata(df)
    >>> print(station_dict["Bank/Monument"])
    [('Waterloo', 4)]
